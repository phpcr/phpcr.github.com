title: Monthly updates to continue on CMF website
---

After some discussion we decided that it would be better to report PHPCR news
on the [CMF website](http://cmf.symfony.com/news). This makes sense as PHPCR
is maintained by the CMF team and it is better to pool our resources into a
single news channel that covers all aspects of the CMF.

So, subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://cmf.symfony.com/news.rss) and follow
the [@SymfonyCMF](http://twitter.com/SymfonyCMF) on Twitter to stay updated.

Until next time...
